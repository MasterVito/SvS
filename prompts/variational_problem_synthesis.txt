As an expert in educational assessment and mathematical problem synthesis, carefully examine the following model-generated response:

<response>
{REPLACE}
</response>

The solution is assured to be correct. Your goal is to generate variants for the original problem that would most plausibly elicit such a response. To achieve this, carefully follow these steps:

1. Identify the topic and context indicated by the response.
2. Infer the type of reasoning or calculation involved (e.g., numerical calculation, conceptual explanation, comparison, opinion).
3. Determine the most likely educational purpose or learning objective behind the problem.

Based on your analysis, write a clear, concise, and natural-sounding original problem in English that satisfies the following criteria:

- Precisely aligns with the provided response.
- Reflects a realistic problem that could appear in an educational context or standard curriculum.
- Is explicit, measurable, and unambiguous.

Provide your final synthetic problem formatted strictly as:
